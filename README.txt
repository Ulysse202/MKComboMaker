Welcome to the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Combo Maker! This project allows you to explore various combinations of characters, vehicles, tires, and gliders, providing detailed stats and information for each combination. Whether you're a competitive racer or a casual fan, this tool helps you optimise your racing setup.

MK8 deluxe is very restrictive when it comes to showing the stats of a combo as it even goes to hide the most important stat of all mini-turbo. This stat is so important that all the best combos in the game are based around it, and you the player can't even properly investigate it. So I decided to make my very own combo maker, that will show you all the stats, and i mean all of them. All the types of speed, all the types of handling and more.

ROAD MAP:
- Info about each combo: I want to generate a small text paragraph for each combo that outlines the strengths and weaknesses of each combo. 
- Compare screen: This would allow the user to compare two combos together. 
- Stat based selection screen: This would allow for the user to find a combo directly by manipulating the stats. This would make finding a combo that has a particular weakness or strength much easier.
